        <p>We happened to create the association on December 4th, 2015 as everyone knows that Haiti is a poor country. Most of people have many problems (economic, housing, clothing, food and water). When the Earthquake came in Haiti, there were many broken homes. There are many events that passed before this too, such as hurricanes that destroyed many of the crops. My staff and I decided to start this organization in hopes of helping people who are in physical, emotional and spiritual needs. Since the earthquake we have known to help people though we have always had projects for such an association. In spite of all difficulties we have met in our way, we do not give up because our mission is to help people who are in these deep needs such as kids who cannot eat. We see the organization is on the way to success by the grace of God, and we believe with God all will be okay. <!-- praise Jesus Christ --></p>

I was born on June 16,1974. I did not grow up in a Christian family but i had a passion for children and for God. After my father died, i decided to accept Christ as my Savior. I became a new man, because Jesus washes my sins away. I see the situation of some people and I decided to help any way i could. Mr Woodly called me and he said: "Do you agree to be part of AYAP?" I said yes cause i saw In Woodly a lot of good things and I thank God for that. I think AYAP will move forward because the staff does a lot for people with a pure heart.</p>

I'm Rilphene Pierretil,born on March 13,1983 in Artibonite, Gonaives city. I was born in a Christian family as well as my parents but i did not understand well sense of God words. On January 12,2010 I learned a great lesson through the Bible. I happened to understand that God is the king of kings through a catastrophe that killed more than 8 thousands people. If my family and I are alive, it's thanks to God. It's there i would go to help people who were unable because after this catastrophe, most of them slept in the street. There even some who couldn't eat because of lack of opportunity. My mind was upset about it. I shared with people who were next to me because i didn't have much to go around to help with, but today i'm part of AYAP and the staff who have the same aims. We think the work will move forward more and it will please God. <!-- in Jesus name --></p>
